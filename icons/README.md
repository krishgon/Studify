# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Design**: Should represent education/studying (e.g., books, graduation cap, brain)
- **Colors**: Use the Studify brand colors (#007bff for primary)
- **Style**: Clean, modern, and recognizable at small sizes

## Placeholder Icons

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders.
You can create simple colored squares or download free icons from sites like:
- Flaticon
- Icons8
- Feather Icons

## Future Enhancement

In future commits, we'll add proper branded icons that match the Studify identity.
